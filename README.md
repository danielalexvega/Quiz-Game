# Quiz-Game

A simple JavaScript game that quizzes the user on the 50 state capitals. It gives you a time limit, and your final score is based on the time left on the clock when you complete the quiz. 

Every correct answer is counted, and every incorrect answer takes away 10 seconds from your timer. 

Your score is saved in local storage, and if your score is in the top three, it will be saved in the high scores list with the user's name. 

This project was a homework assignment for the UT Coding Bootcamp.
